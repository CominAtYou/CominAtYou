### Hi there, I'm Comin. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student who spends most of my time playing video games and watching anime. I also spend a lot of my time doing Discord bot and web development, which is why a lot of my repositories are HTML and/or JS based (A lot of which are private repositories because they're personal projects).

#

When I'm not doing dev work, you can find me either watching anime or YouTube, playing games (most likely A Hat in Time), screaming at homework or my Ubuntu server (shell scripts are *fun*), wasting hours in various Discord Servers, or attempting to make food.
