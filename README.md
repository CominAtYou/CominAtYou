### Hi there, I'm Comin. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student who spends most of my time playing video games and watching anime. I also spend a lot of my time doing Discord bot and Android development, which is why a lot of my repositories are HTML and/or JS based (A lot of which are private repositories because they're personal projects).

## ðŸŽ® Stuff I do
Most of my projects are mostly just things I do for my own enjoyment or things that make mundane tasks easier (see [CustomEmojiUploader](https://github.com/CominAtYou/CustomEmojiUploader) or DesktopActions). Some are also just utilities (like [the Express backend for my website](https://github.com/CominAtYou/Spotify-Express-Backend))

In my spare time, I like to play a lot of my games. Some of my favorites include:
- A Hat in Time
- Celeste
- Super Mario Galaxy
- Outer Wilds
- No Man's Sky

## ðŸ”¨ Things I use
I prefer TypeScript for most of my projects, but also use:
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript (Node)
- Kotlin (Android)
- HTML/CSS/JS
