### Hi there, I'm Comin. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student who spends most of my time doing Discord bot and Android development, which is why a lot of my repositories are Java or JS-based (A lot of which are private repositories because they're personal projects).

## ðŸŽ® Stuff I do
Most of my projects are mostly just Android apps that I make for my own enjoyment or to make mundane tasks easier (for example, [Silverpoint](https://github.com/CominAtYou/Silverpoint) or [BatteryTile](https://github.com/CominAtYou/BatteryTile))

In my spare time, I like to play a variety of (mostly indie) games. Some of my favorites include:
- A Hat in Time
- Celeste
- Forza Horizon 5 & 4
- OneShot
- Outer Wilds
- Hollow Knight

## ðŸ”¨ Things I use
I prefer a variety of languages for most of my projects, but mostly use:
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript (Node)
- HTML/CSS/JS

I also use a lot of toolsâ€”namely Electron, Docker, Express, Linux environments (Debian on WSL/physical hardware), to name a few.
