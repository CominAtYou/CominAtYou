## Hi there!

I'm a soon-to-be CS student student who spends most of my time working on random projects that I come up with on a whim, or sometimes contributing to others' projects that I find useful.

## Things I use
I prefer a variety of languages and frameworks for my projects, but mainly use:
- Java
- JavaScript/TS (Node)
- HTML + Tailwind + JS
- C#
- C/C++
