### Hi there, I'm Comin. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student who spends most of my time doing Discord bot and Android development, which is why a lot of my repositories are Java or JS-based (A lot of which are private repositories because they're personal projects).

## ðŸŽ® Stuff I do
Most of my projects are mostly just Android apps that I make for my own enjoyment or to make mundane tasks easier (for example, [Silverpoint](https://github.com/CominAtYou/Silverpoint) or [BatteryTile](https://github.com/CominAtYou/BatteryTile))

In my spare time, I like to play a variety of (mostly indie) games, or make art. 

## ðŸ”¨ Things I use
I prefer a variety of languages and frameworks for my projects, but mainly use:
- Java
- JavaScript (Node)
- HTML + Tailwind + JS
- C#
- C/C++
